1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,010
You've reached the end of
the deep learning module.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,320
Congratulations.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,820
&gt;&gt; Roy you sounded just
like Sebastian right there.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,920
&gt;&gt; Thank you,
I try to be just like Sebastian.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,380
So do you feel like a deep
learning expert now?

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,260
&gt;&gt; Well I wouldn't
necessarily say expert, but

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,758
I think I know what tools I've got.

8
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:23,340
All right, I think you're ready to
build a behavioral cloning network.

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,090
The team at Udacity has built an awesome
simulator for you .It's going to be

10
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,610
your job to drive your car around
the track, collect the data and

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,575
then train the deep neural network
to do the driving for you.

12
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:40,330
So How would you approach
this kind of problem?

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,080
&gt;&gt; Well I guess I know.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,266
I'd compute the gradient.

15
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,358
[SOUND] Yeah, and
then once I've got the gradient-

16
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:49,195
&gt;&gt; Stop, stop, stop.

17
00:00:49,195 --> 00:00:50,100
This is deep learning.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,841
&gt;&gt; What?

19
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:51,490
&gt;&gt; Not computer vision, deep learning.

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,070
&gt;&gt; No, no gradient?

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,010
&gt;&gt; No, focus.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,690
Deep learning.

23
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:53,843
&gt;&gt; Got it.

24
00:00:53,843 --> 00:00:54,844
Okay.

25
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:59,751
[SOUND] Then I think I'd
go fire up my simulator.

26
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,090
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,463
When you're done you're going to have an
awesome portfolio project to show off.

28
00:01:06,463 --> 00:01:08,184
Actually that was kind of cool.

29
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:15,029
[SOUND]
